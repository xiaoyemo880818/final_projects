    Guests of hotel without shuttle:
    In our simulation model, we suppose that distance will influence the guest number of a certain hotel.
    The farther away the hotel is from New York city center, the less guest it can get. Therefore, we define
    a negative linear relationship between variable GuestRate and variable distance, which means when the hotel
    is n miles closer to the city center, k*n percent of overall tourists they can get.(k is the slope)
    We get the highest guest rate and lowest guest rate from the number of reviews on TripAdvisor. You can see
    more details in reference_guestrate file in Github.

    Guests brought by shuttle:
    Since shuttle service will bring more guests for the hotel, we need to consider its influence.
