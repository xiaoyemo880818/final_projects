The simulation scenario is that we plan to construct a hotel in New York city. SO we want to estimate the overall profit level of all the hotels in New York and find out what variables will have influence on the profit.
## Variables:

### 1. Location of the hotel
	This variable will influence the number of guests, since different tracts has different population.
	This variable will also influence the cost of constructing a hotel.

### 2. The price level
	This variable will fluctuate in a certain time span, and we can get the statistical distribution from 
	real-world dataset.

### 3. The number of hotel rooms
	We will consider the cost and profit of the rooms. (when the room number is more than the guest number 
	or the opposite)

### 4. Whether we have shuttle service
	 We will consider the human cost of shuttle service , and the guest number it will increase (we suppose 
	 that only in holiday we can pick much more guest at nearby airport)

## Hypothesis:
	1. The closer to the city center, the more profit we can get.
	2. Time will have influence of the overall price level.
	3. The profit of different hotels will satisfy with normal distribution
	4. High frequency of shuttle service will increase hotel profit.
