## Variables:

### 1. Location of the hotel
	<p>This variable will influence the number of guests, since different tracts has different population.</p> 
  <p>This variable will also influence the cost of constructing a hotel.</p>

### 2. The price level
	This variable will fluctuate in a certain time span, and we can get the statistical distribution from real-world dataset.

### 3. The number of hotel rooms
	We will consider the cost and profit of the rooms. (when the room number is more than the guest number or the opposite)

### 4. Whether we have shuttle service
	 We will consider the human cost of shuttle service , and the guest number it will increase (we suppose that only in holiday we can pick much more guest at nearby airport)
